Just in case if you're unaware of how lifesteal smp differs from standard smp, the lifesteal smp makes you lose one heart 
from your overall health everytime you die, regardless of whether you were killed by another player or suffered environmental 
damage. You will be banned as soon as you reach 0 maximum hearts. It won't be a lifelong ban, because someone can use a 
revive beacon to bring you back to life. You can increase maximum hearts by killing others or by crafting them.
